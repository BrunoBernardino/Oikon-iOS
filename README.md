# Oikon iOS

This is the code for the Oikon iOS app, available at https://itunes.apple.com/pt/app/oikon-simple-expense-tracking/id892934335

It's open for everyone to contribute to.

This was my first ever iOS project, and Objective-C experience as well, so I know the structure is not great.

If there are suggestions, I'd appreciate them!
